# SafeChain – Anonymous Crime Reporting System

## Overview
SafeChain is a blockchain-based Anonymous Crime Reporting System designed to provide citizens with a secure and confidential mechanism to report crimes.  
The system ensures transparency, immutability, and anonymity through Hyperledger Fabric, while interoperability is enabled via Hyperledger Cacti for cross-network integration.  

Key Features:
- Anonymous and secure crime reporting  
- Immutable blockchain-backed records  
- Authorized access for law enforcement  
- Real-time data monitoring and analytics  
- Cross-chain interoperability with Cacti

## Technology Stack
- **Blockchain:** Hyperledger Fabric  
- **Interoperability:** Hyperledger Cacti  
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express)  
- **Frontend:** React.js  
- **Database (off-chain):** MongoDB / PostgreSQL  
- **Deployment:** Docker & Kubernetes
